To be productive, you have to readjust to your new environment quickly and efficiently. Here are some tips that I have used in my travels:\n\n\n## Micro-Habits\n\nWe as humans love habits. The brain creates an imprint map of the process and stories so that it can use it again and again. For my geeks out there, it’s like creating a function for your brain. Once you’ve written a function, you can call it at any time and create a trigger for your brain to run the program. Habits work in the same way. Unlike programming, creating a trigger and generating the habit takes time. Studies have shown habits take up to two months to form.\n\nWhen we land in a foreign country, we feel the euphoria of novelty but the reptilian part of your brain is firing off and trying to evaluate the new environment. It is making sure that this new environment is safe. The “fight or flight” response is triggered. It is an acute stress that starts the moment you leave the airplane. Repeated activation of this stress can affect how you perceive the world around you. Habits can help the reptilian part of your brain understand that the new environment is safe and quickly dissolve the acute stress.\n\nI’ve created micro-habits for myself so that my brain instantly knows that this space and location is home. I’ve listed a few of my habits below. You will create habits that work for you.\n\nI rise with the sun. This is a great way to acclimate your body to the new time zone.\nI have a semi-structured work day. I wake up and work for the first 3 hours. My walk break happens around 9 a.m. and my work day is over around the afternoon at 2 or 3 p.m. Coffee and oatmeal in the morning trigger the start of my work day. When the brain feels strained (every 90 min of productive work), go for a walk. This is a good habit for everyone. If you want more information on habits, I recommend reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.\n\n\n## Understand your needs\n\nNurture your body and respect its needs. Fitness and health is an important component of productivity. Accessibility to places to stay fit and fresh fruits and vegetables are a requirement for me. I love yoga, acrobatics, and Crossfit. I find one or all of these studios in the countries I visit. You live while you travel, you don’t live to travel. That world famous chop suey cart on the corner of your Airbnb is probably not the most stable food source for your body.\n\n\n## Getting Lost\n\nThe first few days, you need to familiarize yourself with the new environment. My favorite way to explore an area is to get lost in it. For the first few day, I will put my phone on airplane mode and walk. I will quickly absorb everything in my surrounding and note all the little landmarks. Make a mental note of the cafes for work, eating spots, gyms, and whatever interest you.\n\nThis is how your brain adjusts to the environment. If you are lost, go ahead and turn on your GPS. You should be able to find your way back after a few days of exploring.\n\nThere is no one solution for the nomad lifestyle. This is what works for me. My experiences are primarily in Asia.

This restriction never hindered China’s internal development. In fact, the nature of the government control fuel local developers and tinkerers to duplicate and create tools for their digital ecosystem. All the tools that exist in our everyday digital life, China has the exact clone of the tool and often time there is an added to feature to solve specific localize issues. We have Google; China has Baidu. We have Facebook; China has Weibo. It’s a whole different world, where your expertise and skills are tested for adaptability.\n\nAfter supporting America made, Chinese websites for the past two years, I’ve compiled a list of my research and finding for developers who are building for Chinese clients. Since the government closely monitors tools outside of China, you will almost always run into performance issues if you’re unaware of the content restriction at every step of the build out. Luckily, China has its ecosystem of digital tools for web development. You’ll find a list of alternative tools for creating website inside the Great Firewall.\n\n\n## Design\nA common Chinese website can look like this.\n\n{% img  /img/1688china.png [100%] [1688 China [Sample Chinese Website]] %}\n\nOr this.\n\n{% img  /img/chinadaily.png [100%] [China Daily [Sample Chinese News Website]] %}\n\n\nMy designer senses are tingling. I’m getting design clutterfobic. The cluttered feeling is related to how the Chinese language display on screen and paper. There is no capitalize system, and the spacing between the character are limited. Any font styling such as bold, italic and underline creates less white space and often time the corporate behind the notion of Chinese site being too “busy.” There is also two type of Chinese character set, simplified and non-simplified. You are limited to how the paragraphs of text are going to appear on the site. It doesn’t mean the design can not look clean and crisp. Get ready, to introduce them to white space, clean design and content filled imagery. I recommend collecting an arsenal of beautifully designed sites for your initial design call.\n\nSince we are on the subject of fonts, let’s spend a little bit of time on font management. Unlike the alphabetic languages, the Chinese character system requires many more character text. Naturally, the font faces heavier in file size and much more complicated to display. You’ll notice many fonts hosted on your servers are three times the size of alphabetic language fonts. Keep the font file size in mind; this is part of your site performance budget.\n\nFor detail implementation information, I recommend reading Kendra Schaefer’s blog post on Chinese fonts.\nhttp://www.kendraschaefer.com/2012/06/chinese-standard-web-fonts-the-ultimate-guide-to-css-font-family-declarations-for-web-design-in-simplified-chinese/\n\nThe ever-so-popular, Google font is inaccessible inside of China without VPN. The vast number of Chinese visitors will not be able to see your beautiful font face. China has two font libraries available for use. I recommend reviewing the available font library before designing the site.\nhttp://en.justfont.com/fonts\nhttps://www.youziku.com/\n\nThere has been some success with Typekit. I’ve run into two occasions where the fonts are blocked. Typekit support resolved the issue.\n\nJavascript and jquery libraries\nSorry! Bootstrap, Fontawesome, and jquery libraries are all hosted outside of China. Luckily Chinese internet companies have duplicated these libraries and hosted them on their servers. Check out http://www.bootcdn.cn.\n\nFor open source plug-ins, be sure use tools with CDN accelerator and research to make your CDN distributes their services inside of China. Cloudfare services have networks inside China.\n\n\n## Video and Social Media Services\nInside China, WeChat is the all-in-one application to replace, Facebook, Twitter, Venmo payment system, Uber, etc. China tech market is amazingly quick and adaptable to the changing tech world. They understand mobile apps (It’s pronounced APP. I’m not sure why but the Chinese believe it is an acronym rather than an abbreviation.) are the future. WeChat a phone messaging app so integrating onto your website is currently not possible. They are working on an API. China is building a whole ecosystem around this one app. WeChat support business pages, push notification marketing, payment, car rental and more. You can get almost any services on WeChat. If you want to do business inside China, you better be ready to generate WeChat marketing. For the website, many of the clients will add a QR to redirect users to their WeChat business page.\n\nFor embed video services, you’ll likely be using Youku.com. Youku is the youtube equivalent inside of China. Videos hosting on the hosting server is an option, but of course, the server needs to inside China for this to be effective.\n\n\n## Analytics\nHere’s a curve ball. While all Google services are considered banned inside China, Google Analytics is allowed. The government enabled it quietly to allow website tracking. A few of my former clients use Google Analytics in conjunction with Baidu Analytics.\n\nSince we’re tackling the performance issue, you’ll need to be more rigid with the best practices for general site optimization. Review all images and media for web optimization. Minimalist in all areas of the website is the key to success. China’s digital ecosystem is constantly changing and shifting. If anyone notices, any updates, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

It was a wonderful two years of travel and work but it was time for a change. With travel and work, the constant burn out is all too common. Aside from needing some R & R time, I needed to step away from my day-to-day work. It was time for me to re-learn and discover what’s out there. I picked up new tools and different ways of building websites and lived in locations where it would have been difficult to manage work and travel. Now it’s time for me to get back to the work force. Here are my thoughts on my first few months of job hunting.\n\nAlthough, I am seeking new opportunities. I am in no rush to receive an offer. My former employer, Finalsite is one of the best places to work for. I knew it was going to be even harder to find a company that is a better fit or at least of the same caliber.\n\nSince job hunting process is done once every few years, relearning is part of the process. My first lesson was how to create attention grabbing online presence for recruiter and companies. I am venturing into the rapidly growing remote job market. The seven-seconds rule applies to every component of your online persona. The resume, personal site, online blog and social media are all required components of my online resume. Your work history and identity is highlighted with a single Google search.\n\n\n## Online Persona\n\nFor the first few weeks, I was using my generic Word doc template resume. The same one I used five years old with updated job experiences. I tried to shove my years of experience in one page and failed miserably. My resume was a large compile summary of my experience bled into one page black, white and green PDF. I received call backs on 10% of my application and for companies that I wasn’t particularly interested in working for. A friend in marketing saw my resume and provide me with a much-needed push to improve.\n\n\n1. **Design Matters.** There are no more excuses for crappy resume design. There are so many free design templates and software out there that’ll help you create a beautiful visual resume. Canva and Piktochart are my two favorites. You got 5 seconds to grab a recruiter’s attention. I doubled my callback and interview requests after the redesign.\n\n2. **Research the industry title for the job you are looking for and reflect that title in your summary, job title.** Let’s be honest, job titles don't tell people what you do or what you are capable of. It is going to prevent a filter bot from finding you and vice versa. I had years of experience but I didn’t know how to properly market myself. My previous job title didn’t reflect the industry job title. The bots and filters on job search engines were displaying in the accurate job opening. I started updating my job title to the Support industry titles. I begin to use the industry job title for the position I am seeking.\n\n\n3. **Your social media tells a story about you.** I didn’t receive any requests for references. When your life is searchable, there’s no need to contact your friend and former colleagues. Sadly, their opinion is irrelevant in comparison to thousands of posts and images that paint a beautiful portrait of your inner thinking or at least at the very least your public persona. The hiring team can come up with their own conclusion on what type of person you are.\n\n4. **Portfolios are no longer optional.** Show people what you can do. I made an online portfolio or resume with a timeline of the things I been working on. It includes writings, presentations and projects. This is difficult for a support professional since many of the projects I participated in are private and property of my former company. In these cases, I grabbed some screenshots (no personal info) and wrote a project summary to explain what I did. I can not stress enough that you need to write, blog and document anything that shows the world that you’ve done something. People can lie on resumes. They can’t fake projects.\nWhen your life is searchable, there’s no need to contact your friend and former colleagues. Sadly, their opinion is irrelevant in comparison to thousands of posts and images that paint a beautiful portrait of your inner thinking or at least at the very least your public persona.\n\n## Remote Jobs\n\nI have been living in the freelance and remote work bubble for two years. Within the first week of job hunting, I realized how small that bubble is. Almost all the job search tools had limited search for remote jobs. Job search engines filter around a location. Did you know that there’s a ton of job openings in Remote, Oregon? Although I have been working remotely and lived in the remote work community, the rest of the job market is still location-based. I didn’t realize that many remote workers have transitioned into remote work due to location changes or by request. Full remote hires are still a small percentage of the job market.\n\nBefore I dive into the remote job world. Let’s take a look at why companies are hiring remote employees.\n\n- **It is a remote company.** There are a small number companies that built their company around remote-first culture. Here's a running list of those companies, [here](https://github.com/jessicard/remote-jobs).\n- **Limited local talent.** The company can not offer relocation packages. When a company is based in a quiet town or smaller cities, it’s difficult for them to recruit talent unless they present a relocation package. Some companies are expanding their search and offering remote work. This is great for both job seekers and employer.\n- **The position requires someone with a specific combination of skills.**\n{% img  /img/particularsetofskills.jpg [100%] [Particular Set of Skills [Taken]] %}\nYou must know all of these codes, under infrastructure and be a wordsmith that makes your clients feel like they’re flying on a cloud. There are countless numbers of insane requirements that a small number of applicants are truly qualified for. In those cases, you’ll have to expand your search globally.\n- **The need for around the clock support services.** This is specific to the support field. The customer service industry is changing, we’re no longer bound to location and time zone. People can access their app or software 24/7 and people expect support for the services whenever they’re using it. We’re far from creating a perfect software so there is a  need for remote Support team members. Companies realize that their product can be accessed all over the globe. You can no longer limit support to a specific time zone. There is a spike in remote jobs for the support professional.\n- **Cheap labor.** I avoid these jobs at all cost. The listings are usually part-time remote jobs with no benefits.\n- **It’s extremely competitive.** If you have tons of experience, it may be very easy for you to find jobs in the local area. Now, you’re competing with the world. Your skills need to be on par with everyone in the field. I also had my own set of requirements for the company. I wanted to work for a company that is 100% distributed. When a large part of your company is based in an office, the remote workers will always be the second class employee. It’s hard for the office worker to understand what they do not experience.\n\nTwitter is the best remote job search engine. It's quick, up-to-date and you don't have to sign up for an account. [@jobspresso](https://www.twitter.com/jobspresso) and [@weworkremotely](https://www.twitter.com/weworkremotely) are two of my favorite listing.\n\n\n## Application\n\nMy particular field is likely responsible for the diverse approach to the application process. The degree of support knowledge range from non-technical to junior level developer. It would be an understatement to say the applications are a shit show. It looks like companies copied each other's requirements without understanding what the real needs of the position. There were a few inspirational job applications that made me want to get to know the company.\n\nI love discovering tools that I didn’t know existed. I love applications with a quick exercise. In particular, my application of the process took me down a learning journey through static gen tools, data integration, WordPress and much more. On a different spectrum, I also applied to positions that asked over ten questions and spent up to 3 hours answering. In these cases, I expected a little more than a template rejection letter.\n\nTo make the whole process a little more human, I also received a few requests video introduction. I'd love to see requests for video introductions on all applications. Although I understand this is another piece for the hiring team to review, it's important for the applicant to know that they're not just a number.\n\nI was often disappointed by how inefficient and frustrating the whole hiring process is. I would receive requests for an interview with no guideline as to when or how to schedule. Unless this is an intentional step to delay the hiring process, I find it particularly time-consuming to send several emails back and forth to schedule a date and time. There are scheduling tools such as [Calendly](https://www.calendly.com) or better yet give me a time and I’ll step out of my day job to talk to you. There were a few cases where the company would not return my emails (ghosting). I know that the job hunting is a dreadful process but there are certain steps from both prospective employee and employer can do to approach the process with compassion and understanding to make it as painless as possible. It’s like online dating, you’re trying to find that one special company that is a perfect match but most of us will settle for good enough.\n\nFor smaller companies, the department head or team lead manages the hiring process. These team leads become hiring manager over night with no knowledge of the experience of the hiring process except for their own experience when they first joined the company. There is a need for education and guidance that recruiting management software can offer to the small to medium-sized companies. These tools should set in place hiring best practices and providing consulting services to companies.\n\n{% blockquote %}\nThere is a need for education and guidance that recruiting management software can offer to the small to medium-sized companies. These tools should set in place hiring best practices and providing consulting services to companies.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nIn the case of hiring, the companies are in a stronger position of power. They have the power to hire/reject you. Some companies take advantage of this position. Ideally, the hiring process should be a mutually beneficial to both companies and individual. That means respecting each others time and communicating every step of the process. Lastly, rejections should be communicated early and quickly from both parties involved.\n\nInteraction with users during the application process affect the companies’ overall reputation. As a support professional, I am a huge advocate of brand identity management through every interaction.\n\n## Trial Period\n\nTraditionally, new hires are placed in a probationary period during the first few months of hire. Often time, companies will keep the employee beyond this period even if they are not a good fit. This is because they’ve already invested a lot of time in the person and the benefit of keeping the employee outweighs the restart of the hiring process. A few companies have challenged this traditional practice with a part-time paid trial contract. The prospective employee works 20 - 30 hours a week to see if it is a good fit for both parties. I really love this approach. I have participated in a few trial contracts and love the experience. Not only am I paid for the whole process, I also get an introduction to the inner workings of the company. My only complaint about this process is the trial time. The trial should be no longer than three weeks. At the three weeks point, you and the company should have a sense of the company culture and whether or not the position is mutually beneficial for both parties. I don’t see the benefit of dragging out the decision longer. The number of trial contractors participating affects the experience of the hiring process. Large number trial contractor means the company did not do a proper initial screening. You need a team of three or more people to evaluate one applicant. I love the experience because I walk away from the trial with a new set of skills I can use in the future.\n\nI'm still looking for the one.\n{% img  /img/neo.gif [100%] [Still looking for the One [Still looking for the ONE]] %}\n\n\nIn the meantime, check out my [resume](paulinechin.com) and hire me!\n","source":"_posts/glance-at-the-hiring-process-in-2017.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: A Glance at the Hiring Process in 2018\ndate: 2017-09-02 23:26:19\ncategories: Support Engineer\ntag: Support Engineer\n---\n\nAbout four months ago I completed my Support Engineer contract with [Finalsite](http://www,finalsite.com).

Here's a running list of those companies, [here](https://github.com/jessicard/remote-jobs).\n- **Limited local talent.** The company can not offer relocation packages. When a company is based in a quiet town or smaller cities, it’s difficult for them to recruit talent unless they present a relocation package. Some companies are expanding their search and offering remote work. This is great for both job seekers and employer.\n- **The position requires someone with a specific combination of skills.**\n{% img  /img/particularsetofskills.jpg [100%] [Particular Set of Skills [Taken]] %}\nYou must know all of these codes, under infrastructure and be a wordsmith that makes your clients feel like they’re flying on a cloud. There are countless numbers of insane requirements that a small number of applicants are truly qualified for. In those cases, you’ll have to expand your search globally.\n- **The need for around the clock support services.** This is specific to the support field. The customer service industry is changing, we’re no longer bound to location and time zone. People can access their app or software 24/7 and people expect support for the services whenever they’re using it. We’re far from creating a perfect software so there is a  need for remote Support team members. Companies realize that their product can be accessed all over the globe. You can no longer limit support to a specific time zone. There is a spike in remote jobs for the support professional.\n- **Cheap labor.** I avoid these jobs at all cost. The listings are usually part-time remote jobs with no benefits.\n- **It’s extremely competitive.** If you have tons of experience, it may be very easy for you to find jobs in the local area. Now, you’re competing with the world. Your skills need to be on par with everyone in the field. I also had my own set of requirements for the company. I wanted to work for a company that is 100% distributed. When a large part of your company is based in an office, the remote workers will always be the second class employee. It’s hard for the office worker to understand what they do not experience.\n\nTwitter is the best remote job search engine. It's quick, up-to-date and you don't have to sign up for an account. [@jobspresso](https://www.twitter.com/jobspresso) and [@weworkremotely](https://www.twitter.com/weworkremotely) are two of my favorite listing.\n\n\n## Application\n\nMy particular field is likely responsible for the diverse approach to the application process. The degree of support knowledge range from non-technical to junior level developer. It would be an understatement to say the applications are a shit show. It looks like companies copied each other's requirements without understanding what the real needs of the position. There were a few inspirational job applications that made me want to get to know the company.\n\nI love discovering tools that I didn’t know existed. I love applications with a quick exercise. In particular, my application of the process took me down a learning journey through static gen tools, data integration, WordPress and much more. On a different spectrum, I also applied to positions that asked over ten questions and spent up to 3 hours answering. In these cases, I expected a little more than a template rejection letter.\n\nTo make the whole process a little more human, I also received a few requests video introduction. I'd love to see requests for video introductions on all applications. Although I understand this is another piece for the hiring team to review, it's important for the applicant to know that they're not just a number.\n\nI was often disappointed by how inefficient and frustrating the whole hiring process is. I would receive requests for an interview with no guideline as to when or how to schedule. Unless this is an intentional step to delay the hiring process, I find it particularly time-consuming to send several emails back and forth to schedule a date and time. There are scheduling tools such as [Calendly](https://www.calendly.com) or better yet give me a time and I’ll step out of my day job to talk to you. There were a few cases where the company would not return my emails (ghosting). I know that the job hunting is a dreadful process but there are certain steps from both prospective employee and employer can do to approach the process with compassion and understanding to make it as painless as possible. It’s like online dating, you’re trying to find that one special company that is a perfect match but most of us will settle for good enough.\n\nFor smaller companies, the department head or team lead manages the hiring process. These team leads become hiring manager over night with no knowledge of the experience of the hiring process except for their own experience when they first joined the company. There is a need for education and guidance that recruiting management software can offer to the small to medium-sized companies. These tools should set in place hiring best practices and providing consulting services to companies.\n\n{% blockquote %}\nThere is a need for education and guidance that recruiting management software can offer to the small to medium-sized companies. These tools should set in place hiring best practices and providing consulting services to companies.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nIn the case of hiring, the companies are in a stronger position of power. They have the power to hire/reject you. Some companies take advantage of this position. Ideally, the hiring process should be a mutually beneficial to both companies and individual. That means respecting each others time and communicating every step of the process. Lastly, rejections should be communicated early and quickly from both parties involved.\n\nInteraction with users during the application process affect the companies’ overall reputation. As a support professional, I am a huge advocate of brand identity management through every interaction.\n\n## Trial Period\n\nTraditionally, new hires are placed in a probationary period during the first few months of hire. Often time, companies will keep the employee beyond this period even if they are not a good fit. This is because they’ve already invested a lot of time in the person and the benefit of keeping the employee outweighs the restart of the hiring process. A few companies have challenged this traditional practice with a part-time paid trial contract. The prospective employee works 20 - 30 hours a week to see if it is a good fit for both parties. I really love this approach. I have participated in a few trial contracts and love the experience. Not only am I paid for the whole process, I also get an introduction to the inner workings of the company. My only complaint about this process is the trial time. The trial should be no longer than three weeks. At the three weeks point, you and the company should have a sense of the company culture and whether or not the position is mutually beneficial for both parties. I don’t see the benefit of dragging out the decision longer. The number of trial contractors participating affects the experience of the hiring process. Large number trial contractor means the company did not do a proper initial screening. You need a team of three or more people to evaluate one applicant. I love the experience because I walk away from the trial with a new set of skills I can use in the future.\n\nI'm still looking for the one.\n{% img  /img/neo.gif [100%] [Still looking for the One [Still looking for the ONE]] %}\n\n\nIn the meantime, check out my [resume](paulinechin.com) and hire me!\n","slug":"glance-at-the-hiring-process-in-2017","published":1,"updated":"2018-08-03T09:07:04.000Z","_id":"cjylwpfsc000mad1aqutmio5a","comments":1,"photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>About four months ago I completed my Support Engineer contract with <a href=\"http://www,finalsite.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Finalsite</a>.

Large number trial contractor means the company did not do a proper initial screening. You need a team of three or more people to evaluate one applicant. I love the experience because I walk away from the trial with a new set of skills I can use in the future.</p>\n<p>I’m still looking for the one.<br><img src=\"/img/neo.gif\" title=\"[100%] [Still looking for the One [Still looking for the ONE]]\"></p>\n<p>In the meantime, check out my <a href=\"paulinechin.com\">resume</a> and hire me!</p>\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"Lessons from Three Years of Travel and Work","date":"2019-07-27T17:26:19.000Z","_content":"\nIt has been the greatest privilege to have the opportunity to travel while working with my former company. Living the dream does come with its own challenges and rewards.

Behind that picture perfect, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/paulinechin) photo is fifty photos overrun by garbage and trash created by us. My heart hurts to see how much we have neglected our home.\n\n#### Air Quality Index 389: Beijing, China\n{% img  /img/beijing.jpg [100%] [Beijing Air Quality Index 389: Beijing, China] %}\n\n\n\n#### Expectation vs. Reality, Seminyak beach: Bali, Indonesia\n{% img  /img/baliexpectation.jpeg [100%] [Expectation, Seminyak beach: Bali, Indonesia] %}\n\n\n\n{% img  /img/balireality.jpg [100%] [#Officefortheday: Bali, Indonesia] %}\n##### #Officefortheday: Bali, Indonesia\n\n\n\n#### We love Budapest: Budapest, Hungary\n{% img  /img/budapest.jpg [100%] [We love Budapest?] %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's easy to ignore something that does not affect us directly. We get so caught up in our own struggles, we fail to see others. It's no surprise that travel forces you to see outside of your own comfort zone. It takes courage and discipline to allow your experience to change the way you live.\n\n\nFor me, this is living a simple life without many material things. It is living a life with zero/ little waste and saying no to plastic. Lastly, giving back to every community by spending locally, eating ethically and influencing through action.\n\n## Urgency of Time\n\nAs Boston Latin Class of 2007, we choose 100 years by five for fighting as our graduation song. At the time, I felt annoyed at the intense negativity this song represented for such a joyous event. It was not until I returned home, I realize how powerful this song and the encouragement it's meant to install in the new graduates. We only have 100 years to live, live it well, and strive to create a meaningful impact every minute, hour and days.\nYour time is the most valuable thing. Become an efficient worker so you can be more productive with fewer hours. Before leaving the office, I spent 40+ hours \"working\". The real breakdown is a little more alarming.\n\n\n* 30% of that time in the office is spent socializing.\n* 40% spent on meaningless redundant tasks that can be automated or improved.\n* 20% spent on distractions\n* **10% productive work**\n\n\nI'm not saying this is bad. We all do this. Distractions allow our brain to explore, socializing and connecting with colleagues help us reduce stress, and small accomplishments from redundant tasks keep us motivated throughout the day.\nRemote work disrupted these four components of \"work\" and help me understand, you don't have to work more hours to accomplish more. We can shift our time spent on socializing to automate meaningless work. We can discipline ourselves and reduce the time we spend distracted.\n\n\nWe can become more efficient and spend less time doing busy work in order to dedicate time to projects that we want to focus on.\n\n## Comfort in the Discomfort\nWhen you're constantly moving every few months, you never get a chance to get too comfortable in a country. You live every day with a hint of urgency and you get better at adapting to unexpected changes.\n\n\nI came out of this journey living curiously and carelessly. We rarely experience life/death situations and there's almost no amount of daily stress that should equate to the anxiety and stress we express. No matter how unhappy or painful I feel with the situation I'm in, I know I am extremely lucky in this life.\n\n## Time Doesn't Stand Still for Anyone\nTime is a priceless entity. In the generation littered with FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), you'll realize you can't be in all of these countries to experience life with your newly made friends without physically being there. You'll lose touch and friends will become acquaintances. Connections will fade.\n\n\nI made many connections during my travels but I had to choose who I want to dedicate time to, which story I want to write and who to write it with. Being a nomad is like living the best part of a vacation over and over again. While you're caught up in the excitement of the experiencing novelty, other stories are written parallel to yours. Your best friends will experience new jobs, boyfriends, start a family, time with a new member of the family. Life with your loved ones will be written without you. There lies your decision. Do I choose to sacrifice these experiences or do I choose to experience the moments with my loved ones? \n\n\nI choose the latter for now.\n","source":"_posts/lessons-from-three-years-of-travel.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Lessons from Three Years of Travel and Work\ndate: 2019-07-27 18:26:19\ncategories: Mindful Living\ntags: Sustainability, Mindful Nomad\n---\n\nIt has been the greatest privilege to have the opportunity to travel while working with my former company.
